# videos
## LAMP stack based project.
Using Python to scrape my previous purely html presentation of encoded TV shows and movies, to import the data into a MariaDB database.
The URL's point to videos stored on a NAS on my LAN using an Nginx web server to stream them to a web-browser. The database resides on a Raspberry Pi on my LAN that is running MariaDB and PHP.
The real purpose of this project is to learn how to make a web interface that uses a database to do something useful, and have an easy way for my family to find and watch the videos in our library.
